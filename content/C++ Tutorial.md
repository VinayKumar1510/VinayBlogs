## Why Learn C++?

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that is widely used in software development. It is the language of choice for system/software, game development, drivers, client-server applications, and embedded firmware. Learning C++ can open up many career opportunities and provide a strong foundation for understanding other programming languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with C++, you need to set up a development environment. This includes installing a C++ compiler and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Popular choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and IDEs like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, and CLion.

## Basic Syntax and Structure

C++ programs consist of functions and classes. The `main` function is the entry point of any C++ program. Here is a simple example of a C++ program:

## Basic Code
```c
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
